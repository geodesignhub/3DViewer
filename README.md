# GDH-3DViewer
A one-click 3D viewer for designs on Geodesignhub, using [OSM Buildings](https://osmbuildings.org/) library. This plugin takes design data from the [Geodesign Hub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api) and transforms the polygons drawn to random buildings and road generation. In addition, the generated footprint data can be downloaded as GeoJSON and the map can be zoomed and panned. In addition, features can be filtered per system. 

### Adding the plugin
The plugin can be added to a project through the project administration panels.
